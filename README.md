# Expense Tracker

A personal expense tracking app built with **Node.js**, **Express**, and **SQLite**. Deploy it on a VPS or run locally — your data stays on your server.

**Version 2.3.1**

## Features

### ➕ Add Expenses
Quickly add expenses with date, details, category, and amount. Success confirmation shown after each entry. Supports backdating — pick any past date and the entry sits in its correct chronological position.

- **Duplicate detection** — If you try to add an expense with the same date, details, and amount as an existing entry, the app warns you and asks for confirmation before proceeding.
- **Double-click prevention** — The Add button disables while the request is in flight, preventing accidental duplicate submissions on slow networks.

### 📋 Copy Expenses (Monthly Recurring)
Copy any expense to the same day-of-month across multiple months — ideal for recurring bills.
- Click the 📋 icon on any expense row (tracker or reports)
- Enter the **first occurrence date** and **number of months**
- The expense is duplicated to the same day-of-month (e.g., the 2nd) for each consecutive month
- Smart **month overflow handling** — Jan 31 + 1 month = Feb 28 (last valid day)

### 🔔 Recurring End Notification
When a recurring series is approaching its end, you get notified.
- **Bell icon** in the header with badge count
- **Notification panel** slides in showing which series is ending and on what date
- Badge appears on the **last occurrence date** and stays for **7 days**
- Auto-deletes after 7 days — no stale notifications
- Mark as read (badge disappears) or dismiss permanently

### 📊 Reports & Charts
- **2 Pie Charts** — Category breakdown for the selected month and the previous month, side by side
- **Bar Chart** — Yearly overview with monthly totals (double-width for better readability)
- **Drill-down Report Table** — Year → Month → Day → Individual expenses, fully expandable/collapsible
- **Mobile stacked layout** — On phones, the report table converts to a vertical card layout — no horizontal scrolling needed
- **Copy, Edit & Delete from Reports** — Copy, edit, or delete any expense across any time period directly from the report view
- **Category Filter** — Filter reports by category alongside year, month, and date range selectors
- **Default View** — Reset button to restore the default hierarchy (year/month expanded, days collapsed)
- **Auto-refresh** — Switching to the Reports tab automatically loads the latest data

### 📋 Monthly Summary
Shows a **Total** plus a breakdown by all configured categories for the current month.

### 🏷️ Configurable Categories
- Add up to **15 custom categories** from Settings
- Each category has a **color** (chosen from a preset palette of 15 distinct colors — no repeats)
- **Rename** categories inline — propagates to all historical expenses in the database
- **Change color** — click the color dot to pick a new one
- **Delete** categories (with warning about historical impact)
- **Batch Category Reassignment** — Move all expenses from one category to another before deleting

### 🌙 Dark Mode
Toggle between light and dark themes via the header icon. Preference saved in localStorage.
- **Premium SaaS-style dark theme** — Softer borders, layered surfaces, reduced visual noise
- **Consistent design system** — CSS variables for backgrounds, borders, text colors
- **All components themed** — Cards, tables, forms, modals, settings, charts, reports

### 🔒 App Lock
- Set a **6-digit numeric PIN** to lock the app
- **Recovery code** shown once on setup — save it securely
- Unlock via PIN or recovery code
- **Remember for today** — check the option to skip the PIN for the rest of the day (same browser)
- Enter key works on all PIN inputs

### 📥 CSV Download
Export expenses as CSV with flexible date selection:
- By year and month
- By custom date range (From/To)
- **All Years** option for complete data export

### 🔍 Filters & Search
Filter the expense table by:
- **Date range** — Start and End date
- **Category** — Any configured category or All
- **Search** — Text search across expense details
- **Collapsible** — Filters are hidden by default behind a toggle button so the table is immediately visible

### ✨ Autocomplete Details
Start typing in the Details field and it suggests previously used entries.
- **Smart splitting** — comma-separated entries are split into individual phrases for better suggestions
- **Recency-based** — most recently used phrases appear first
- **Debounced** — waits 250ms after typing stops, shows max 8 suggestions (optimized for mobile)

### 🔄 Batch Operations
- **Batch Rename** — Rename all entries with the same detail string in one go (suggestions capped at 8, same as tracker)
- **Batch Category Reassignment** — Move all expenses from one category to another (useful before deleting a category)

### 📱 Mobile-Responsive Design
Fully responsive from desktop down to 400px screens:
- **Scrollable tabs** on narrow screens
- **Slide between tabs** — Touch and slide anywhere on screen to page-turn between Tracker, Reports, Downloads, Settings (native scroll-snap)
- **Pull-to-refresh** — Pull down on iPhone PWA (Add to Home Screen) to refresh all data
- **Touch-friendly targets** — 44px minimum tap areas
- **Card-style table on mobile** — Expense rows become stacked cards
- **Stacked form fields** — Single column on phones
- **Charts stack vertically** on small screens
- **Reports stacked layout** — No horizontal scroll on the report table
- **Scroll-to-top button** — Appears on scroll, disappears at top
- **No iOS zoom on focus** — Input font-size set to 16px to prevent Safari auto-zoom

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (v18 or later)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)

### Install & Run

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/dcvibecodes/expense-tracker-app.git

# 2. Go to the project folder
cd expense-tracker-app

# 3. Install dependencies
npm install

# 4. Start the server
npm start
```

The app will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

The database file is created automatically at `data/expenses.db` on first run.

### Upgrading from v2.3.0

Deploy the updated files (`public/app.js`, `public/styles.css`, `public/index.html`, `public/sw.js`, `package.json`, `README.md`) and restart the server. No database changes — fully backward compatible.

### Upgrading from v2.2

Deploy the updated files (`server.js`, `public/app.js`, `public/styles.css`, `public/index.html`, `package.json`, `README.md`) and restart the server. No database changes — fully backward compatible.

### Upgrading from v2.1

Deploy the updated files and restart the server. No database changes — fully backward compatible.

### Upgrading from v2.0

Deploy the updated files and restart the server. No database changes — fully backward compatible.

### Upgrading from v1

If you have an existing database from v1:
1. Back up your database: `cp data/expenses.db data/expenses.db.backup`
2. Deploy the new code files (`server.js`, `public/app.js`, `public/styles.css`, `public/index.html`)
3. Restart the server

The server automatically migrates the schema on startup:
- Creates the `categories` table and seeds defaults (Needs, Wants, Other)
- Removes the old CHECK constraint from the expenses table
- All existing data is preserved
